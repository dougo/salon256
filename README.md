# Randomwalk

A very small program to be presented at Nick Montfort's
[Salon 256](https://nickm.com/post/2017/04/salon-256-on-may-1/).

To run this program, you'll need a wordlist file. The NPL has a number of
[wordlists](http://www.puzzlers.org/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=solving:wordlists:about:start);
I recommend [ENABLE](http://www.puzzlers.org/pub/wordlists/enable1.txt).

Once you've downloaded the wordlist file:

```
ruby randomwalk.rb <wordlist>
```
